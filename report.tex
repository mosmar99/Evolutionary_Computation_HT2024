\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\textcolor{red}{The recommended software for typesetting assignment reports is \LaTeX. It will allow you to prepare high-quality documents, especially in the area of Computer Science. This document can serve as a template for reports. Each section begins with brief instructions in red text. All the instructions in red, as well as the dummy text, should be removed in the final version to submit. The \LaTeX\ source of this file includes examples of using the most needed commands and environments. You can find plenty of other examples with explanations in many web forums and discussion groups on the Internet. The easiest way to edit your report is to use \url{https://www.overleaf.com/}. Overleaf does not require any setup on your computer, and it is free to create an account.}

\textcolor{red}{The book \textit{Writing for Computer Science} \cite{zobel2014writing} is a useful assistance on how to write properly and present your work when it comes to Computer Science topics. It is a strong recommendation to follow its guidelines and limit the usage of AI tools to generate text. Keep in mind that the examiner is an expert in Evolutionary Computation and therefore, any false information generated by an AI tool is easily notable. Such case may lead to failing the assignment.}

\textcolor{red}{The introduction should briefly introduce the assignment and its purpose.}

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem_description}

\textcolor{red}{The second section should present the problem you tackle using your evolutionary approach. Overall, this section should include:}

{\color{red}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The mathematical formulation considered in your study. Some problems have a clear mathematical model (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem), while others do not (e.g., $n$-Queens). Based on the problem you chose, search the literature and find a proper way to present the problem.
    \item One paragraph that briefly presents at least 3 published academic works where any evolutionary approach is used to solve the problem. It would be wise to cite here works that influenced your algorithm. This practice saves you time from looking for additional academic resources. You can find more information about reading and searching in the literature in \cite{zobel2014reading}.
    \item The motivation behind the evolutionary approach you decided to develop. A good practice would be to align the motivation with some literature gap found in the academic works you presented above. However, this is not mandatory. You can motivate your selection on the characteristics of the algorithm making it proper for the problem.
\end{itemize}
}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Note:} Change the section's title to match the name of the problem you chose for your assignment.}

\lipsum[2]


\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

\textcolor{red}{The third section should present the evolutionary approach you developed. You can divide this section into subsection. In any case, you should mention the following details:}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Evolutionary approach.} Clearly describe the algorithm you developed. You should clearly explain the evolutionary operators you used and what modifications you did to match the problem. It is extremely important to present also a pseudocode of your algorithm. An example is given in \ref{alg:pseudocode_example}, below. For more insight into presentation of algorithms, you can advise \cite{zobel2014algorithms}.}

{
\color{red}To typeset pseudocode in \LaTeX\ you can use one of the following options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose ONE of the (\texttt{algpseudocode} OR \texttt{algcompatible} OR \texttt{algorithmic}) packages to typeset algorithm bodies, and the algorithm package for captioning the algorithm.
    \item The \texttt{algorithm2e} package.
\end{itemize}
You can find more information here: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms}
}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Example of an algorithm's pseudocode}\label{alg:pseudocode_example}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Require $n \geq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$
\State $y \gets 1$
\State $X \gets x$
\State $N \gets n$
\While{$N \neq 0$}
\If{$N$ is even}
    \State $X \gets X \times X$
    \State $N \gets \frac{N}{2}$  \Comment{This is a comment}
\ElsIf{$N$ is odd}
    \State $y \gets y \times X$
    \State $N \gets N - 1$
\EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Solution representation.} Clearly describe the solution representation you used. You can use figures to improve the comprehensibility of this part.}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fitness function.} It is also very important to mention the fitness function you used. In many cases, the objective function of the problem is not the same as the fitness function used in an evolutionary algorithm. An example, following the principles of \cite{zobel2014mathematics}, is given below.}

\begin{equation}
    F = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2 
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ is the $i$-th gene (i.e., decision variable) in the solution and $d$ corresponds to the number of decision variables in the problem.

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Note:} Change the section's title to match the name of the algorithm you developed for your assignment.}
